Machine Learning and Deep Learning are trendy topics and it is a promising area. As a Software Engineer, it's identified as a Data Scientist subject but it sounded so cool that I decided to dig it. Here are my day-to-day notes on this long journey to master the field.

Hello world for CNNs, make a simple network that predicts the MNIST digits

[https://keras.io/examples/mnist_cnn/](https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet/)

- check out how the model is built after you compile it with: model.summary()
- try changing a few parameters in the model and check out how it looks now
- when you train the model, change some of the factors like: batch_size, epochs and learning rate
- print out how the data looks for the different pre-processing steps
- Start lesson 1 [fast.ai](http://fast.ai)

Tasks: 

- [x]  Continue [lesson 1 fast.ai](https://course19.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1)
- [ ]  Train model on MNIST dataset

I have seen how to download a dataset, how to create a DataLoaders and how to train a pre-trained model.

In the learner, I see different types of layers: Conv2d, BatchNorm2d, ReLU, MaxPool2d, etc.

Questions:

- What does freeze and unfreeze
- What's a kernel
- What's a sequential model
- What each layer does
