Hey, I’m Yanael, never away from a keyboard, learning, designing and building software. Currently working as a Software Engineer for a [startup](https://sprout.ai) in London, I’m handling data in my day to day basis. Formerly in Paris where I studied at [42](http://42.fr) and had different company experiences along the way. 

Startups and Silicon Valley enthusiast, I spent some time in the Bay Area, drinking Blue Bottle’s and owning a Patagonia jacket.

I like to chat with people when it starts with:  
> _I don’t shave, I drink coffee and The Art of UNIX Programming is on my nightstand._
