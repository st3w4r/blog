Hello world for CNNs, make a simple network that predicts the MNIST digits

[https://keras.io/examples/mnist_cnn/](https://keras.io/examples/vision/mnist_convnet/)

- check out how the model is built after you compile it with: model.summary()
- try changing a few parameters in the model and check out how it looks now
- when you train the model, change some of the factors like: batch_size, epochs and learning rate
- print out how the data looks for the different pre-processing steps
- Start lesson 1 [fast.ai](http://fast.ai)
